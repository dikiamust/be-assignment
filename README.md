# Take home assignment

## Description:

Build 2 Backend services which manages userâ€™s accounts and transactions (send/withdraw).

In Account Manager service, we have:

- User: Login with Id/Password
- Payment Account: One user can have multiple accounts like credit, debit, loan...
- Payment History: Records of transactions

In Payment Manager service, we have:

- Transaction: Include basic information like amount, timestamp, toAddress, status...
- We have a core transaction process function, that will be executed by `/send` or `/withdraw` API:

```js
function processTransaction(transaction) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    console.log('Transaction processing started for:', transaction);

    // Simulate long running process
    setTimeout(() => {
      // After 30 seconds, we assume the transaction is processed successfully
      console.log('transaction processed for:', transaction);
      resolve(transaction);
    }, 30000); // 30 seconds
  });
}

// Example usage
let transaction = { amount: 100, currency: 'USD' }; // Sample transaction input
processTransaction(transaction)
  .then((processedTransaction) => {
    console.log('transaction processing completed for:', processedTransaction);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('transaction processing failed:', error);
  });
```

Features:

- Users need to register/log in and then be able to call APIs.
- APIs for 2 operations send/withdraw. Account statements will be updated after the transaction is successful.
- APIs to retrieve all accounts and transactions per account of the user.
- Write Swagger docs for implemented APIs (Optional)
- Auto Debit/Recurring Payments: Users should be able to set up recurring payments. These payments will automatically be processed at specified intervals. (Optional)

### Tech-stack:

- Recommend using authentication 3rd party: Supertokens, Supabase...
- `NodeJs` for API server (`Fastify/Gin` framework is the best choices)
- `PostgreSQL/MongoDB` for Database. Recommend using `Prisma` for ORM.
- `Docker` for containerization. Recommend using `docker-compose` for running containers.

## Target:

- Good document/README to describe your implementation.
- Make sure app functionality works as expected. Run and test it well.
- Containerized and run the app using Docker.
- Using `docker-compose` or any automation script to run the app with single command is a plus.
- Job schedulers utilization is a plus

## be-assignment is a lightweight backend application developed using NestJS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.

## Clone

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dikiamust/be-assignment

cd be-assignment
```

## Environment Variables

You can see it in the .env.example file

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

## Installation

```sh
yarn # or yarn install
```

## Database Migration

```sh
# Generate Prisma Client
 yarn db:generate

#  run migration
yarn db:migrate

#  run seeder
yarn db:seed

```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ yarn start

# watch mode
$ yarn start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn start:prod

# Docker Compose
$ docker compose up --build
```

## API Documentation

After running all the commands above (install dependencies, run migration, and seeder) and starting the application, you can access the API documentation at [http://localhost:3000/api-doc](http://localhost:3000/api-doc), which includes information on endpoint usage.

## Application Flow

1. **Register**

   - Use the registration endpoint to create a new user. Upon successful registration, a JWT token is generated. This token is required to access other endpoints.

2. **Login**

   - Alternatively, you can use the login endpoint to generate a JWT token. This token is necessary to access other endpoints.

3. **Create a Payment Account**

   - Use the `POST /payment-account` endpoint to create a new payment account. This account will be linked to the registered user.

4. **Get All User's Payment Accounts**

   - To retrieve all your payment accounts, use the `GET /payment-account` endpoint.

5. **Top-Up Payment Account**

   - Use the `POST /transaction/top-up` endpoint to top-up a payment account. The top-up is processed from the system's payment account, which is generated during the seeding process.

6. **Send Money**

   - Use the `POST /transaction/send/:senderPaymentAccountId` endpoint to send money. You can select the payment account to send from. This endpoint allows sending money to another payment account within this application or to an external payment account, but not both simultaneously.

7. **Withdraw Money**

   - Use the `POST /transaction/withdraw/:senderPaymentAccountId` endpoint to withdraw money. This endpoint only allows withdrawals from your payment account within this application to an external payment account.

8. **Transaction History**

   - To retrieve all transaction histories for a specific account, use the `GET /transaction/:paymentAccountId` endpoint.
